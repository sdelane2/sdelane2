### Hi, I'm Sean ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full stack software engineer with experience in Ruby and JavaScript languages and Rails, React, and Redux frameworks. With 5+ years experience in  contemporary art galleries and museums, I am a developer with an eye for design. As a strong team player and problem-solver, I have a proven record of planning, coordinating, and executing elegant projects from the ground up.
