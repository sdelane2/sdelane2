### Hi, I'm Sean ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full stack software engineer with experience in Ruby and JavaScript languages and Rails, React, and Redux frameworks. With 5+ years experience in  contemporary art galleries and museums, I am a developer with an eye for design. As a strong team player and problem-solver, I have a proven record of planning, coordinating, and executing elegant projects from the ground up.


ðŸ”­  Iâ€™m currently working on a TaskRabbit-like web app called Glassine - built with a ReactJS frontend and Rails-API backend. 

ðŸŒ±  Iâ€™m currently studying algorithms and data structures through Udemy's JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass.
